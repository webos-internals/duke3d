This is a WebOS port of JonoF's version of Duke Nukem 3D. You will find this version at 
http://www.jonof.id.au/

It's done by Henk "MetaView" Jonas. With help from rwhitby and the SDLQuake port.
You find more in my blog at http://www.metaviewsoft.de/wordpress or follow me on twitter: @metaview

You need the following files in the Duke3D directory on your internal drive:
